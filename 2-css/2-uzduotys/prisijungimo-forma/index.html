        <p class="text2">Even the slightest sound does not escape this Pokémon’s notice. Azurill’s tail is large and
            bouncy. It is packed full of the nutrients this Pokémon needs to grow. Azurill can be seen bouncing and
            playing on its big, rubbery tail. Girafarig’s rear head contains a tiny brain that is too small for
            thinking. However, the rear head doesn’t need to sleep, so it can keep watch over its surroundings 24 hours
            a day.</p>
